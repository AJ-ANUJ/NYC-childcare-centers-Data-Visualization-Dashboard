Interactive Data Visualization Dashboard to visualize the high dimensional dataset of NYC's childcare centers for finding important insights and facts about them.

# Background & Problem
• In today’s world Child Care Centers are becoming more and more important for working parents.

• In New York, over 800,000 children under the age of six years live in families with parent(s) in the household who work, indicating a substantial potential need for full-time childcare (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey).

• There is also a large potential need for childcare for older children after school and during school vacations, with over 1 million school- age children living in families with working parent(s) (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey).

• Therefore, it becomes essential for these working parents to search for the best childcare facility that is available and one that suits their requirements.

# Approach
With my dashboard, my aim is to visualize the DOHMH childcare inspection data for NYC to provide answers to the questions such as:

• Which NYC borough has the maximum childcare centers ?

• What is the child to educator/caregiver ratio of a particular center ?

• What are the different violation % of childcare centers such as public health hazard violation %?

• How is the performance of a center in the most recent DOHMH inspection ?

# Major Dashboard Features
• 7 plots with a mixture of standard(5) and non-standard plots(2).

• Interactivity for the User provided with the help of linking and brushing ability on the plots.

• Single plot and nested linking and brushing.

• Ability to filter down to a single Childcare Center and see all its details.

• Ability to see the name of each Childcare Center in the form of a tool tip in MDS plot.

• Reset button to bring the dashboard to the original state showing overall statistics.

• Single Screen Dashboard without any scrolling.

# Major Insights
Insights found from analysis of the NYC childcare inspection data through the above dashboard are as follows:

• Maximum number of childcare centers are in Brooklyn.

• Brooklyn has most no. of childcare centers with public health hazard violations and Queens has most no. of critical violations.

• Highest percentage of critical violations is in Bronx.

• Queens has the center with most no of educational workers namely, Sunshine Developmental school.

• Steep positive correlation between total education workers and maximum child capacity.

• 1 childcare center in Manhattan has been operating for more than 75 years, namely ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH OF ST. IGNATIUS LOYOLA.

• Total number of educational workers and violation % are negatively correlated which shows that as no. of educational workers increase, violations decrease.

• From the MDS plot, it is evident that childcare centers in same boroughs can be very different and some childcare centers in different boroughs can be similar.
